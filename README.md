#### Introduction
This is the first assignment for the Hardware Description Language course at NSYSU.  
It mainly covers the following tasks:  
- Designing a 32-bit adder using different Verilog modeling methods (Structural Modeling, Dataflow Modeling, Behavioral Modeling)
- Storing outputs in registers
- Pre/post-synthesis simulation (using **Ncverilog** for pre/post-simulation, using **Design Compiler** for synthesis)
- Comparison of synthesis results.
